DESCRIPTION :

In this task, we performed various SQL join operations—INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, and FULL JOIN—using the OneCompiler platform to combine related data from multiple tables in a structured and meaningful way. These joins help retrieve information that spans across tables, enabling us to generate complete datasets by linking shared columns such as customer IDs or product codes. Through this process, we learned how each type of join behaves when handling matched and unmatched data, which is crucial for ensuring accurate data analysis and reporting. This knowledge is widely applicable in real-world scenarios like e-commerce systems, inventory management, sales tracking, and customer relationship management, where data must be integrated from multiple sources. Leveraging OneCompiler provided an easy and interactive environment to test and understand these joins without the need for complex setup.
